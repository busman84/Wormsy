# Wormsy

## Description

Wormsy is a 2-d infinite side scrolling game. The object of the game is to help the worm escape from the bird that is chasing him.  Avoid little baby birds, tree trunks, and bushes as they all try to get in your way and make you bird food!  Landing on top of an obastacle is okay, however if you get stuck behind one your days as a rolling worm are over!

##  Technologies Used

Using the Unity game engine I was able to create this game with the C# coding language.  I created all of the artwork myself using Adobe Photoshop.  It was extremely fun and rewarding to use Unity because it has many awesome features built in to make game development easier.
